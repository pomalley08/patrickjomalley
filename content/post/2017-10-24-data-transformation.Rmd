This post covers the content and exercises for Ch 5: Data Transformation from [**R for Data Science**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). The chapter teaches how to transform data with dplyr.

# 5.1 Introduction

## 5.1.1 Prerequisites

Use data from the nycflights13 package

```{r nycflight, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## 5.1.2 nycflights13

Will be performing data manipulation on `nycflights13::flights`

```{r flights}
flights
```

## 5.1.3 dplyr Basics

Will use the 5 common functions of dplyr

* `filter()` for picking observations based on their values
* `arrange()` for reordering rows
* `select()` for picking variables by their name
* `mutate` for creating new variables based off of existing variables
* `summarise()` for collapsing many values to a single summary

Can all be used with `group_by()` which changes scope of each function from entire dataset to going group by group

# 5.2 Filter Rows with `filter()`

`filter()` allows you to subset observations based on their values.

## 5.2.4 Exercises

1. Find all flights that  

Had an arrival delay of two or more hours

```{r arr-del-over-2hrs}
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)
```

Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)

```{r houston}
filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
```

Were operated by United, American, or Delta

```{r united-american-delta}
airlines
filter(flights, carrier %in% c("AA", "DL", "UA"))
```

Departed in summer (July, August, and September)

```{r summer-flight}
filter(flights, month %in% c(7, 8, 9))
```

Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late

```{r late-arr-on-time-dep}
filter(flights, arr_delay >120 & dep_delay <= 0)
```

Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight

```{r del-make-up-time}
filter(flights, dep_delay >= 60 & arr_delay < 30)
```

Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

```{r am-flight}
filter(flights, dep_time == 2400 | dep_time <= 0600)
```

2. Another useful dplyr filtering helper is between(). What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?  

`between()` is a shortcut for `x >= left & x <= right`

```{r between}
flights[between(flights$dep_time, 0, 600), ]
```

3. How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?

```{r missing-dep-time}
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
```

Also missing dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay, air_time, they could represent canceled flights  

4. Why is NA ^ 0 not missing? Why is NA | TRUE not missing? Why is FALSE & NA not missing? Can you figure out the general rule? (NA * 0 is a tricky counterexample!)

```{r na}
NA ^ 0 # any value ^0 is 1
NA | TRUE # Logical is true since  one side is true
FALSE & NA # Logical is false since one side is false
NA * 0 # ???
```

Generally, operations including `NA` will be `NA` unless it would return a specific value no matter what the NA was  

# 5.3 Arrange Rows with `arrange()`

Arranges a data frame by columns specified, additional columns are used for tie breakers. `desc()` for descending, and `NA`s are always pushed to the end  

## 5.3.1 Exercises

1. How could you use arrange() to sort all missing values to the start? (Hint: use is.na()).

```{r na-first}
arrange(flights, desc(is.na(dep_time)))
```

2. Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.

```{r most-delayed}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
arrange(flights, dep_time)
```

3. Sort flights to find the fastest flights.

```{r fastest-flights}
arrange(flights, air_time)
```

4. Which flights travelled the longest? Which travelled the shortest?

```{r longest-shortest}
arrange(flights, desc(distance))
arrange(flights, distance)
```

# 5.4 Select Columns with `select()`

Helper functions:  
* `starts_with("abc")`: matches names that begin with "abc".  

* `ends_with("xyz")`: matches names that end with "xyz".

* `contains("ijk")`: matches names that contain "ijk".

* `matches("(.)\\1")`: selects variables that match a regular expression. This one matches any variables that contain repeated characters. You'll learn more about regular expressions in strings.

* `num_range("x", 1:3)`: matches x1, x2 and x3.

## 5.4.1 Exercises

1. Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.

```{r many-selects}
select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
```

2. What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a select() call?

```{r multi-select}
select(flights, dep_time, dep_time)
```

3. What does the one_of() function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?  

`vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")`

```{r one-of}
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
select(flights, one_of(vars))
```

4. Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?  
* By default the helpers ignore case, this can be changed by setting `ignore.case = FALSE`

`select(flights, contains("TIME"))`

```{r contains}
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```

# 5.5 Add new variables with mutate()

It's often useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns. That's the job of `mutate()`.

## 5.5.2 Exercises

1. Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they're not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.  

```{r dep-min-from-midnight}

flights_midnight <- flights %>% 
  mutate(dep_time_hour = dep_time %/% 100, 
       dep_time_min = dep_time %% 100) %>% 
  mutate(sched_dep_time_hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100, 
         sched_dep_time_min = sched_dep_time %% 100) %>% 
  mutate(dep_time_min_mid = dep_time_hour * 60 + dep_time_min,
         sched_dep_time_min_mid = sched_dep_time_hour * 60 + sched_dep_time_min) %>% 
  select(-c(dep_time_hour:sched_dep_time_min))
summary(flights_midnight$sched_dep_time_min_mid)
summary(flights_midnight$dep_time_min_mid)
```

2. Compare air_time with arr_time - dep_time. What do you expect to see? What do you see? What do you need to do to fix it?

```{r compare-airtime}
flights_midnight %>% 
  mutate(air_time_calc = arr_time - dep_time) %>% 
  select(air_time, air_time_calc)
```

These should be the same, the issue is that arr_time and dep_time are not currently continuous values so they cannot be subtracted. Fix by using time from midnight for both arr and dep

```{r arr-min-from-midnight}

flights_midnight <- flights_midnight %>% 
  mutate(arr_time_hour = arr_time %/% 100, 
       arr_time_min = arr_time %% 100) %>% 
  mutate(sched_arr_time_hour = sched_arr_time %/% 100, 
         sched_arr_time_min = sched_arr_time %% 100) %>% 
  mutate(arr_time_min_mid = arr_time_hour * 60 + arr_time_min,
         sched_arr_time_min_mid = sched_arr_time_hour * 60 + sched_arr_time_min) %>% 
  select(-c(arr_time_hour:sched_arr_time_min))
summary(flights_midnight$arr_time_min_mid)
summary(flights_midnight$sched_arr_time_min_mid)
```

```{r compare-airtime-midnight}
flights_midnight %>% 
  mutate(air_time_calc = arr_time_min_mid - dep_time_min_mid) %>% 
  select(air_time, air_time_calc, arr_time_min_mid, dep_time_min_mid) %>% 
  filter(air_time_calc > 0, !is.na(air_time_calc), !is.na(air_time)) %>% 
  sample_n(10000) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = air_time, y = air_time_calc), alpha = 0.1)

```

* Can't explain the offsets  

3. Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?  

* dep_time should be sched_dep_time + dep_delay after converting to continuous

```{r compare-dep-delay}
flights_midnight %>% 
  mutate(dep_time_calc = sched_dep_time_min_mid + dep_delay) %>% 
  select(dep_time_min_mid, dep_time_calc) %>% 
  filter(dep_time_calc < 1440) %>% 
  sample_n(5000) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = dep_time_min_mid, y = dep_time_calc))
```

4. Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for min_rank().
* I'm using min_rank so ties are returned with the rank equal to the lowest rank value (as in sports)

```{r delayed-flights}
flights_midnight %>% 
  select(dep_delay, tailnum) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(dep_delay))) %>% 
  arrange(min_rank(desc(dep_delay))) %>% 
  slice(1:10)
```

5. What does 1:3 + 1:10 return? Why?

```{r vector-math}
1:3 + 1:10
```

* The first 3 values are added however the remaining values are unchanged and a warning is given since the smaller vector is not a multiple of the longer vector

6. What trigonometric functions does R provide?

```{r trig-functions}
#?Trig
```

# 5.6 Grouped Summaries with `summarise()`

`summarise()` collapses a data frame into a single row

## 5.6.7 Exercises


1. Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:

    * A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.

```{r 15-mins-late}

flights %>%
  group_by(flight) %>%
  summarize(early_15_min = sum(arr_delay <= -15, na.rm = TRUE) / n(),
            late_15_min = sum(arr_delay >= 15, na.rm = TRUE) / n(),
            n = n()) %>%
  filter(early_15_min == 0.5,
         late_15_min == 0.5)
```

    * A flight is always 10 minutes late.

```{r always-10-min-late}
flights %>% 
  group_by(flight) %>% 
  summarise(prop.same.late = n_distinct(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE) / n(), 
            mean.arr.delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>%
  filter(prop.same.late == 1 & mean.arr.delay == 10)
```

    * A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.

```{r 30-early-late-50-percent}
flights %>% 
  group_by(flight) %>% 
  summarise(early.30.prop = sum(arr_delay <= -30, na.rm = TRUE) / n(),
            late.30.prop = sum(arr_delay >= 30, na.rm = TRUE) / n(),
            n = n()) %>% 
  filter(early.30.prop == .5 & late.30.prop == .5)
```

    * 99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time it’s 2 hours late.
    
```{r ontime-99-percent}
flights %>% 
  group_by(flight) %>% 
  summarise(early.prop = sum(arr_delay <= 0, na.rm = TRUE) / n(),
            late.prop = sum(arr_delay >= 120, na.rm = TRUE) / n(),
            n = n()) %>% 
  filter(early.prop == .99 & late.prop == .01 )
```
    

Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?  
* Arrival delay is more important since it affects making connections and schedules. Departure delay only affect wait time in the ariport

2. Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as not_cancelled %>% count(dest) and not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance) (without using count()).

```{r alternative-count-dest}
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
        filter(!is.na(dep_time))

not_cancelled %>% count(dest)

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())
```

```{r alternative-weighted-distance}
not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance)

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(distance))
```

3. Our definition of cancelled flights (is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_delay) ) is slightly suboptimal. Why? Which is the most important column?  

```{r determine-canceled-flights}
flights %>% 
  filter(is.na(dep_delay) & !is.na(arr_delay))

```

There are no flights which had a `NA` departure and an arrival time, so we can simplify to only filter for non-NA departures  

4. Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?

```{r canceled-flights-pattern, warning=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(year, month, day))) %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(canceled = sum(is.na(dep_time)),
            date = first(date),
            avg.delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = canceled)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = avg.delay), color = "red")

flights %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(year, month, day))) %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(canceled = sum(is.na(dep_time)),
            date = first(date),
            avg.delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(canceled), y = avg.delay)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

* Yes, there appears to be a relationship between the number of canceled flights and the average delay  

5. Which carrier has the worst delays? Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n()))  

```{r carrier-worst-delays}
flights %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  summarise(avg.delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg.delay))
```

```{r challenge-disentangle-airports}
flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(avg.delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg.delay))

```

* Average delays vary depending on the destination airport. I will attempt to separate airport effects by considering only destinations where each airline made a significant number of stops, and then randomly sample flights to hold the destination constant.

```{r filter-low-destinations}
flights %>% 
        group_by(dest) %>% 
        summarise(num = length(unique(carrier))) %>% 
        arrange(desc(num))
        
```

* There are no airports that had flights from every carrier. Instead I will use only the destinations that had a low average delay so I can assume differences between destinations will be negligable.

```{r filter-low-average-delay-dest}
low_delay_dests <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(avg.delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>% 
  filter(avg.delay > -2 & avg.delay < 12)
```

* Confirm all carriers are still in the data set

```{r check-carrier-count}
flights %>% 
        filter(dest %in% low_delay_dests$dest) %>% 
        count(carrier)
```

* This leaves 71 destinations with low average delays. Now I can recheck the carriers average delays.

```{r unbiased-carrier-delays}
# Results with all destinations
flights %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  summarise(avg.delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg.delay))

# Results filtered for low delay destinations
flights %>% 
        filter(dest %in% low_delay_dests$dest) %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  summarise(avg.delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg.delay))
```

* Filtering out the destinations with high average delays doesn't have a large effect on the rankings. F9 (Frontier) is still the worst airline with an average delay of 21.9 minutes

6. What does the sort argument to count() do. When might you use it?

```{r count-sort}
flights %>% 
        count(dest, sort = TRUE)
```

* The results are automatically sorted into descending order

# 5.7 Grouped Mutates (and Filters)

Grouping is most useful in conjunction with `summarise()`, but you can also do convenient operations with `mutate()` and `filter()`


## 5.7.1 Exercises

1. Refer back to the lists of useful mutate and filtering functions. Describe how each operation changes when you combine it with grouping.  

2. Which plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?

```{r worst-on-time-tailnum}
flights %>% 
        group_by(tailnum) %>% 
        summarise(avg.delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), n = n()) %>% 
        arrange(desc(avg.delay))
```

3. What time of day should you fly if you want to avoid delays as much as possible? 

```{r best-time-of-day}
flights_midnight %>% 
        group_by(hour) %>% 
        summarise(avg.delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
        arrange(avg.delay)
```

* Early morning flights are the best, between 5-7am.

4. For each destination, compute the total minutes of delay. For each, flight, compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.

```{r dest-total-delay}
flights %>% 
        group_by(dest) %>% 
        filter(arr_delay > 0) %>% 
        mutate(tot.delay = sum(arr_delay),
               prop.delay = arr_delay / tot.delay) %>% 
        select(year:day, dest, arr_delay, tot.delay, prop.delay)
```

5. Delays are typically temporally correlated: even once the problem that caused the initial delay has been resolved, later flights are delayed to allow earlier flights to leave. Using lag() explore how the delay of a flight is related to the delay of the immediately preceding flight.

```{r correlated-delays, warning=FALSE}
flights_midnight %>% 
        group_by(origin) %>% 
        arrange(year, month, day, dep_time_min_mid) %>% 
        filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>% 
        mutate(prev.delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = dep_delay, y = prev.delay)) +
        geom_point() +
        geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

6. Look at each destination. Can you find flights that are suspiciously fast? (i.e. flights that represent a potential data entry error). Compute the air time a flight relative to the shortest flight to that destination. Which flights were most delayed in the air?

```{r too-fast-flights}
flights %>% 
        group_by(dest) %>% 
        mutate(avg.airtime = mean(air_time, na.rm = TRUE), std.airtime = scale(air_time), n = n()) %>% 
        select(year:day, dest, air_time, avg.airtime, std.airtime, n) %>% 
        filter(std.airtime < -4) %>% 
        arrange(std.airtime)
```

7. Find all destinations that are flown by at least two carriers. Use that information to rank the carriers.

* Rank by how many of the destinations a carrier flys to

```{r flown-2-carriers}
pop_dest <- flights %>% 
        group_by(dest) %>% 
        summarise(num.carrier = length(unique(carrier))) %>% 
        filter(num.carrier >= 2) %>% 
        arrange(desc(num.carrier))

flights %>% 
        filter(dest %in% pop_dest$dest) %>% 
        group_by(carrier) %>% 
        summarise(num.dests = length(unique(dest))) %>% 
        arrange(desc(num.dests))
```

8. For each plane, count the number of flights before the first delay of greater than 1 hour.

```{r count-flights-under-hour-delay}
plane_dep <- flights_midnight %>% 
        group_by(tailnum) %>%
        filter(!is.na(tailnum), !is.na(dep_time)) %>% 
        arrange(tailnum, year, month, day, dep_time_min_mid) 

planes <- data.frame(tailnum = unique(flights$tailnum), count.to.hour = rep(0, length(unique(flights$tailnum))))

for (i in 1:length(planes)) {
        plane <- planes[i]
        plane_temp <- plane_dep %>% filter(tailnum %in% plane)
        k <- 0
        for (j in 1:length(plane_temp)) {
                if (plane_temp$arr_delay[j] > 60) {
                        k <- k + 1
                }
                else {
                        break
                }
        }
        planes$count.to.hour[i] <- k
}
```
