This post covers the content and exercises for Ch 10: Tibbles from [**R for Data Science**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). The chapter teaches how to use the tidyverse version of data frames called tibbles.

## 10.5 Exercises

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
```

1. How can you tell if an object is a tibble? (Hint: try printing mtcars, which is a regular data frame). 


```{r identify-tibble}
mtcars

as_tibble(mtcars)
```

* One indication is that the rownames are removed from tibbles. When printing to the console it is obvious since the variable classes are displayed under the variable names.  

2. Compare and contrast the following operations on a data.frame and equivalent tibble. What is different? Why might the default data frame behaviours cause you frustration?  

```{r compare-tibbles}
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df$x
df[, "xyz"]
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]

df <- tibble(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df$x
df[, "xyz"]
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]
```

* data.frame allows for the partial matching from `$x` to `xyz`
* data.frame converts the text to a factor
* data.frame returns a vector when selecting a single column, while tibble maintains the information in a data frame

3. If you have the name of a variable stored in an object, e.g. var <- "mpg", how can you extract the reference variable from a tibble?  

```{r ref-variable}
var <- "mpg"
mtcars[[var]]
```

4. Practice referring to non-syntactic names in the following data frame by:

    1. Extracting the variable called 1.

    2. Plotting a scatterplot of 1 vs 2.

    3. Creating a new column called 3 which is 2 divided by 1.

    4. Renaming the columns to one, two and three.

```{r non-syntactic}
annoying <- tibble(
  `1` = 1:10,
  `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`))
)

# 1
annoying$`1`

# 2
annoying %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = `1`, y = `2`)) +
        geom_point()

# 3
annoying$`3` <- with(annoying, `2` / `1`)
annoying$`3`

# 4
(annoying <- rename(annoying, one = `1`, two = `2`, three = `3`))
```

5. What does tibble::enframe() do? When might you use it?  

```{r enframe}
enframe(1:3)
c(a = 5, b = 7)
enframe(c(a = 5, b = 7))

```

* converts named vectors to data frames

6. What option controls how many additional column names are printed at the footer of a tibble?  
```{r option-columns}
print(as_tibble(mtcars), n_extra = 1)
```
