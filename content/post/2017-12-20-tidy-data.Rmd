This post covers the content and exercises for Ch 12: Tidy Data from [**R for Data Science**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). The chapter teaches how to apply the organizational structure of tidy data to achieve a consistent format for data.

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# 12.2 Tidy data

The concept of tidy data allows for a consistent format for data. The simple practical instruction for achieving tidy data are:
1. Put each dataset in a tibble.
2. Put each variable in a column.

## 12.2.1 Exercises

1. Using prose, describe how the variables and observations are organised in each of the sample tables.  

```{r table1}
# table1
# > # A tibble: 6 × 4
# >       country  year  cases population
# >         <chr> <int>  <int>      <int>
# > 1 Afghanistan  1999    745   19987071
# > 2 Afghanistan  2000   2666   20595360
# > 3      Brazil  1999  37737  172006362
# > 4      Brazil  2000  80488  174504898
# > 5       China  1999 212258 1272915272
# > 6       China  2000 213766 1280428583
```

* `table1` is in tidy format. The 4 variables are the columns and each observation is a row.

```{r table2}
# table2
#> # A tibble: 12 × 4
#>       country  year       type     count
#>         <chr> <int>      <chr>     <int>
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999      cases       745
#> 2 Afghanistan  1999 population  19987071
#> 3 Afghanistan  2000      cases      2666
#> 4 Afghanistan  2000 population  20595360
#> 5      Brazil  1999      cases     37737
#> 6      Brazil  1999 population 172006362
#> # ... with 6 more rows
```

* `table2` has two variables combined into a single variable `type`. This means there are twice as many observations as with the tidy data.

```{r table3}
# table3
#> # A tibble: 6 × 3
#>       country  year              rate
#> *       <chr> <int>             <chr>
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999      745/19987071
#> 2 Afghanistan  2000     2666/20595360
#> 3      Brazil  1999   37737/172006362
#> 4      Brazil  2000   80488/174504898
#> 5       China  1999 212258/1272915272
#> 6       China  2000 213766/1280428583
```

* `table3` combines the `count` variable into `rate` and stores it as a character to maintain to two values for `cases` and `population` in the single variable. The labels for those values are no longer in the data.

```{r table4}
# Spread across two tibbles
# table4a  # cases
#> # A tibble: 3 × 3
#>       country `1999` `2000`
#> *       <chr>  <int>  <int>
#> 1 Afghanistan    745   2666
#> 2      Brazil  37737  80488
#> 3       China 212258 213766
# table4b  # population
#> # A tibble: 3 × 3
#>       country     `1999`     `2000`
#> *       <chr>      <int>      <int>
#> 1 Afghanistan   19987071   20595360
#> 2      Brazil  172006362  174504898
#> 3       China 1272915272 1280428583
```

* `table4` splits the data into two different tables, `a` and `b`. In these tables the years are split into two different variables. There is an observation for each country in these tables.  

2. Compute the rate for table2, and table4a + table4b. You will need to perform four operations:  

    1. Extract the number of TB cases per country per year.
    2. Extract the matching population per country per year.
    3. Divide cases by population, and multiply by 10000.
    4. Store back in the appropriate place.  
Which representation is easiest to work with? Which is hardest? Why?  

```{r table2-calc-rate}
table2 <- data_frame(country = c(rep("Afghanistan", 4), rep("Brazil", 4), rep("China", 4)),
                     year = rep(c(1999, 1999, 2000, 2000), 3),
                     type = rep(c("cases", "population"), 6),
                     count = c(745, 19987071, 2666, 20595360, 37737, 172006362, 80488, 174504898, 212258, 1272915272, 213766, 1280428583))
table2

(tb_cases <- table2 %>% 
        filter(type %in% "cases"))
(tb_pop <-  table2 %>% 
        filter(type %in% "population"))


rate <- tb_cases
rate$rate <- tb_cases$count / tb_pop$count * 10000
rate
```

3. Recreate the plot showing change in cases over time using table2 instead of table1. What do you need to do first?  

```{r table2-plot}
table2 %>% 
        filter(type %in% "cases") %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count)) +
        geom_point(aes(color = country), size = 3) +
        geom_line(aes(group = country))
```

* First you need to filter `type` for `cases`.

# 12.3 Spreading and gathering

Often need to resolve one of two common problems when tidying data:  

1. One variable might be spread across multiple columns.  

2. One observation might be scattered across multiple rows.  

## 12.3.3 Exercises

1. Why are gather() and spread() not perfectly symmetrical?
Carefully consider the following example:  

```{r spread-vs-gather}
(stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2016, 2016),
  half  = c(   1,    2,     1,    2),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.92, 0.17)
))
stocks %>% 
   spread(year, return) %>% 
   gather("year", "return", `2015`:`2016`)
```




(Hint: look at the variable types and think about column names.)  

Both spread() and gather() have a convert argument. What does it do?  

* In the example `year` is converted to `character` when it is gathered back after being spread. This happens because `convert` is by default `FALSE` so it does not attempt to determine the appropriate class for new columns. When `convert` is set to `TRUE`, the year is correctly converted to a number when gathered as seen in the example below.  

```{r convert-true}
stocks %>% 
   spread(year, return) %>% 
   gather("year", "return", `2015`:`2016`, convert = TRUE)
```

2. Why does this code fail?

```{r failing-gather, error=TRUE}
(table4a <- table2 %>% 
        filter(type %in% "cases") %>% 
        spread(year, count) %>% 
        select(-type))

table4a %>%
  gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

* Since the years are numbers they need to be selected with backticks as in the example below.  

```{r using-backticks}
table4a %>%
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases", convert = TRUE)
```

3. Why does spreading this tibble fail? How could you add a new column to fix the problem?

```{r spread-fail, error=TRUE}
(people <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,    ~value,
  #-----------------|--------|------
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       45,
  "Phillip Woods",   "height",   186,
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       50,
  "Jessica Cordero", "age",       37,
  "Jessica Cordero", "height",   156
))

people %>% 
        spread(key, value)
```

* It fails since there are two values for Phillip in age. Fix by adding an index.

```{r fix-with-index}
(people <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,    ~value,  ~index,
  #-----------------|--------|--------|------
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       45,    1,
  "Phillip Woods",   "height",   186,    1,
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       50,    2,
  "Jessica Cordero", "age",       37,    1,
  "Jessica Cordero", "height",   156,    1
))

people %>% 
        spread(key, value)
```

4. Tidy the simple tibble below. Do you need to spread or gather it? What are the variables?

```{r tidy-preg}
preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes",     NA,    10,
  "no",      20,    12
)

preg %>% 
        gather(male, female, key = "sex", value = "count")
```

# 12.4 Separating and uniting

`separate()` is used when multiple variables are stored together in a single variable.  
`unite()` is the inverse.  

## 12.4.3 Exercises

1. What do the extra and fill arguments do in separate()? Experiment with the various options for the following two toy datasets.  

```{r separate-testing}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))
```
