This post covers the content and exercises for Ch 11: Data Import from [**R for Data Science**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). The chapter teaches how to read in plain text files of data.

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# 11.2 Getting started

Using {readr} to load text files.

## 11.2.2 Exercises

1. What function would you use to read a file where fields were separated with
"|"?  

* `read_delim()`

2. Apart from file, skip, and comment, what other arguments do read_csv() and read_tsv() have in common?  

* col_names
* col_types
* locale
* na
* quoted_na
* quote
* trim_ws
* n_max
* guess_max
* progress

3. What are the most important arguments to read_fwf()?  

* file
* col_positions

4. Sometimes strings in a CSV file contain commas. To prevent them from causing problems they need to be surrounded by a quoting character, like " or '. By convention, read_csv() assumes that the quoting character will be ", and if you want to change it you'll need to use read_delim() instead. What arguments do you need to specify to read the following text into a data frame?  

`"x,y\n1,'a,b'"`  

```{r read-text}
(text <- read_csv("x,y\n1,'a,b'", quote = "'"))
```

5. Identify what is wrong with each of the following inline CSV files. What happens when you run the code?  

```{r fix-code-1}
# only 2 column names
# drop last column
read_csv("a,b\n1,2,3\n4,5,6")
```

```{r fix-code-2}
# 3 col names, 1st row has two obs, 2nd row has 4 obs
# add NA to 1st row, drop 4th col from 2nd row
read_csv("a,b,c\n1,2\n1,2,3,4")
```

```{r fix-code-3}
# 2 col names, 1st row has one obs
# add NA to 1st row
read_csv("a,b\n\"1")
```

```{r fix-code-4}
# a and b are coerced to character since they contain text
read_csv("a,b\n1,2\na,b")
```

```{r fix-code-5}
# should use read_delim
read_delim("a;b\n1;3", delim = ";")
```

# 11.3 Parsing a vector

## 11.3.5 Exercises

1. What are the most important arguments to `locale()`?

```{r locale}
#?locale()
```

2. What happens if you try and set decimal_mark and grouping_mark to the same character? What happens to the default value of grouping_mark when you set decimal_mark to ","? What happens to the default value of decimal_mark when you set the grouping_mark to "."?

```{r locale-practice, error=TRUE}
locale(decimal_mark = ",", grouping_mark = ",")
# error occurs

locale(decimal_mark = ",")
# default gouping mark changed to "."

locale(grouping_mark = ".")
# default decimal mark changed to ","
```

3. I didn't discuss the date_format and time_format options to locale(). What do they do? Construct an example that shows when they might be useful.

* From the readr vignette, `time_format` currently isn't used but `date_format` is used to specify the format of the dates in the data

```{r date-format}

parse_guess("01/12/2017", locale = locale(date_format = "%d/%m/%Y"))
```

4. If you live outside the US, create a new locale object that encapsulates the settings for the types of file you read most commonly.  

* Luckily I'm in the US

5. What's the difference between read_csv() and read_csv2()?  

* The difference is in the default delimeter.
* `read_csv()` uses a comma
* `read_csv2()` uses a semicolon

6 What are the most common encodings used in Europe? What are the most common encodings used in Asia? Do some googling to find out.  

* UTF-8 has been the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web since 2009, and as of November 2017 accounts for 90.3% of all Web pages.  

7. Generate the correct format string to parse each of the following dates and times:  

```{r parse-dates-and-times}
d1 <- "January 1, 2010"
parse_date(d1, format = "%B %d, %Y")

d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
parse_date(d2, format = "%Y-%b-%d")

d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
parse_date(d3, format = "%d-%b-%Y")

d4 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
parse_date(d4, format = "%B %d (%Y)")

d5 <- "12/30/14" # Dec 30, 2014
parse_date(d5, format = "%m/%d/%y")

t1 <- "1705"
parse_time(t1, format = "%H%M")

t2 <- "11:15:10.12 PM"
parse_time(t2, format = "%I:%M:%OS %p")
```
